  |   Unleash an arsenal of shots and strategies in all-out tennis          |
  |   battles with friends, family, and fan-favorite Mushroom Kingdom       |
  |   characters. Whether you play locally, online, or using simple         |
  |   motion controls, intense rallies await! In Adventure mode,            |
  |   experience a new favor of tennis gameplay, with a variety of          |
  |   missions, boss battles and more.                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Complete missions and boss battles in Adventure mode while            |
  |   mastering the controls. Test your hard-earned skills in singles or    |
  |   doubles with up to 4 players in local or online multiplayer, not to   |
  |   mention Tournament Mode, which lets you challenge the CPU. Store up   |
  |   energy and use it to pull off amazing feats: move so fast the world   |
  |   slows down around you or aim in first-person to send the ball         |
  |   crashing down! Your rivals may attempt to block you, but if they      |
  |   fail, their racket will take damage-and break after three hits.       |
  |   Fully charge your energy to launch the ball with enough force to KO   |
  |   your opponent!                                                        |

  |   * Use energy to leap after the ball, slow down time, aim in           |
